Simple chrome javascript extension to animate the gif
photos and gif links on the very important facebook group
www.facebook.com/groups/animatedgifs.  To install, you can
just click "raw" from github or anything that links the
single .user.js file from chrome.  Installs as chrome
extension and can be removed from there as well.
